### Age Category

The game should be appropriate for players of age 12 and more. As a guideline, the [PEGI 12](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) rating is used.

> Video games that show violence of a slightly more graphic nature towards fantasy characters or non-realistic violence towards human-like characters would fall in this age category. Sexual innuendo or sexual posturing can be present, while any bad language in this category must be mild.
